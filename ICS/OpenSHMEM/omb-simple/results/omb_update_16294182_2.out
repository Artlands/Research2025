--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Slurm process starter for PRTE detected the presence of an MCA
parameter in the environment that assigns custom command line arguments
to the `srun` command used to start PRTE's daemons on remote nodes:

  Paramater value: --external-launcher

This warning is provided to alert you (the user) to a perhaps
unintentional setting of command line arguments, or the unseen
overriding of your intended arguments by Slurm.

Background: Starting with Slurm version 23.11, a command line argument
(`--external-launcher`) was added to `srun` to indicate that the
command was being initiated from within a third-party launcher (e.g.,
`prte` or `prterun`). This allows Slurm to essentially freely modify
the `srun` command line while retaining a backward compatibility
capability when explicitly told to use it.  Notably, the Slurm
environment does this by automatically setting the
PRTE_MCA_plm_slurm_args environment variable to pass in its own
command line arguments.  This has the side effect of overriding most
user- or system-level settings.  Note that arguments passed on the
PRTE command line will override any Slurm setting of the
PRTE_MCA_plm_slurm_args environment variable, but with potentially
undesirable side effects if newer versions of `srun` misinterpret or
fail to understand the user-specified arguments.

If the setting of the MCA parameter was intentional, or if the
parameter looks acceptable to you, then please set the following
MCA parameter to disable this warning:

  Environment: PRTE_MCA_plm_slurm_disable_warning=true
  Cmd line: --prtemca plm_slurm_disable_warning 1
  Default MCA param file: plm_slurm_disable_warning = true

If you did not intentionally set the identified command line
arguments and do not wish them to be used, then set the
following MCA param to have them ignored:

  Environment: PRTE_MCA_plm_slurm_ignore_args=true
  Cmd line: --prtemca plm_slurm_ignore_args 1
  Default MCA param file: plm_slurm_ignore_args = true

Note that if you wish to provide custom `srun` command line
arguments and are finding them being overridden by Slurm, you
can ensure that your values are used by setting them with the
following param:

  Environment: PRTE_MCA_plm_slurm_force_args=foo
  Cmd line: --prtemca plm_slurm_force_args foo
  Default MCA param file: plm_slurm_force_args = foo

Note that you may need to add the `--external-launcher` option
to your provided args to ensure that `srun` properly functions
if you are using a relatively recent release of Slurm.
